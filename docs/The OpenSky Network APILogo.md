OpenSky REST API¶
The root URL of our REST API is:

https://opensky-network.org/api
There are several functions available to retrieve state vectors, flights and tracks for the whole network, a particular sensor, or a particular aircraft. Note that the functions to retrieve state vectors of sensors other than your own are rate limited (see Limitations).

All State Vectors¶
The following API call can be used to retrieve any state vector of the OpenSky. Please note that rate limits apply for this call (see Limitations). For API calls without rate limitation, see Own State Vectors.

Operation¶
GET /states/all

Request¶
You can (optionally) request state vectors for particular airplanes or times using the following request parameters:

Property

integer

The time in seconds since epoch (Unix time stamp to retrieve states for. Current time will be used if omitted.

icao24

string

One or more ICAO24 transponder addresses represented by a hex string (e.g. abc9f3). To filter multiple ICAO24 append the property once for each address. If omitted, the state vectors of all aircraft are returned.

In addition to that, it is possible to query a certain area defined by a bounding box of WGS84 coordinates. For this purpose, add all of the following parameters:

Authentication¶
OpenSky exclusively supports the OAuth2 client credentials flow. Basic authentication with username and password is no longer accepted.

To get started:

Log in to your OpenSky account and visit the Account page.

Create a new API client and retrieve your client_id and client_secret.

Exchange these for an access token, then pass it as a Bearer token on every request.

export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

export TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" | jq -r .access_token)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all | jq .
Tokens expire after 30 minutes. A 401 Unauthorized response means the token has expired - request a new one and retry.

Python Token Manager Example¶
For scripts making multiple calls, use this TokenManager class to handle token refresh automatically:

import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

TOKEN_URL = "https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token"
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"

# How many seconds before expiry to proactively refresh the token.
TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN = 30


class TokenManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token = None
        self.expires_at = None

    def get_token(self):
        """Return a valid access token, refreshing automatically if needed."""
        if self.token and self.expires_at and datetime.now() < self.expires_at:
            return self.token
        return self._refresh()

    def _refresh(self):
        """Fetch a new access token from the OpenSky authentication server."""
        r = requests.post(
            TOKEN_URL,
            data={
                "grant_type": "client_credentials",
                "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
                "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
            },
        )
        r.raise_for_status()

        data = r.json()
        self.token = data["access_token"]
        expires_in = data.get("expires_in", 1800)
        self.expires_at = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=expires_in - TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN)
        return self.token

    def headers(self):
        """Return request headers with a valid Bearer token."""
        return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.get_token()}"}


# Create a single shared instance for your script.
tokens = TokenManager()

# Use it for any API call - the token is refreshed automatically.
response = requests.get(
    "https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all",
    headers=tokens.headers(),
)
print(response.json())
get_token() only fetches a new token when the current one is about to expire.

headers() can be passed directly to any requests call.

Create one TokenManager instance and reuse it for all requests in your script.

Limitations¶
Anonymous users (unauthenticated, bucketed by IP):

Only the most recent state vectors are available - the time parameter is ignored.

Time resolution is 10 seconds: 𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −(𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤⁢ ⁢mod⁡ ⁢10).

Authenticated users:

State vectors up to 1 hour in the past. Requests with 𝑡 <𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −3600 return 400 Bad Request.

Time resolution is 5 seconds: 𝑡 −(𝑡⁢ ⁢mod⁡ ⁢5).

Note

You can retrieve state vectors from your own receivers without any credit cost or time restriction. See Own State Vectors.

API Credits¶
All endpoints consume credits except /states/own. Credits are tracked in three independent buckets - one each for /states/*, /tracks/*, and /flights/*. Spending credits on one endpoint has no effect on the others.

Credit quotas by tier - per endpoint (states, tracks, and flights each have their own independent quota):

Tier

Daily

Standard user

4,000

Active feeder (≥30% uptime/month)

8,000

Note

Active feeder status is recalculated every 2 hours. Tier upgrades take effect after ~50 requests. To confirm you are receiving the 8,000-credit allowance, check that X-Rate-Limit-Remaining exceeds 4,000 at the start of a day.

Credit cost - ``/states/all`` (bounding box area in sq° = latitude range × longitude range):

When credits are available, X-Rate-Limit-Remaining shows your remaining balance. When exhausted, the API returns 429 Too Many Requests and X-Rate-Limit-Retry-After-Seconds indicates how many seconds to wait.

Track by Aircraft¶
Note

The tracks endpoint is purely experimental. You can use the flights endpoint for historical data: Flights in Time Interval.

Retrieve the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time. The trajectory is a list of waypoints containing position, barometric altitude, true track and an on-ground flag.

In contrast to state vectors, trajectories do not contain all information we have about the flight, but rather show the aircraft’s general movement pattern. For this reason, waypoints are selected among available state vectors given the following set of rules:

The first point is set immediately after the the aircraft’s expected departure, or after the network received the first position when the aircraft entered its reception range.

The last point is set right before the aircraft’s expected arrival, or the aircraft left the networks reception range.

There is a waypoint at least every 15 minutes when the aircraft is in-flight.

A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes its track more than 2.5°.

A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes altitude by more than 100m (~330ft).

A waypoint is added if the on-ground state changes.

Tracks are strongly related to flights. Internally, we compute flights and tracks within the same processing step. As such, it may be beneficial to retrieve a list of flights with the API methods from above, and use these results with the given time stamps to retrieve detailed track information.

Operation¶
GET /tracks
